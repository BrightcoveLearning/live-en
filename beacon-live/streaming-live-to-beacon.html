  <summary>In this topic you will learn how to stream a Live event to the Beacon App.</summary>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
   
    <p>To stream a Live event to your Application, you must follow a series of steps to connect your Video Cloud Live account and Brightcove Beacon. </p>
    <p>A high-level view of the process is:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The first is step is create an Event and a Playlist in Brightcove Beacon. This event will become available in the App as a place holder for your video. </li>
    <li>Go to your Video Cloud account and access Live to create your event and obtain the Job ID that will work as an identifier. </li>
    <li>Back in Brightcove Beacon, you will be able to connect your Live streaming putting the Job ID generated in Live platform under the Events section of the platform.</li>
    <li>Wait for the connection and the Live video will start streaming in the Beacon App.</li>
    <li>In the last section, you will see the steps to create a different type of event in Live by a Static Entry Point.</li>
</ol>

    <p>The rest of this document will provide details for each of these steps.</p>
